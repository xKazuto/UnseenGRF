## Getting Started

### Information

* This GRF is made for the Ragnarok online Private Server [NovaRO](https://novaragnarok.com)
* But it should also work for most servers out there.

### Installing
* Download [tokei's grf editor](https://rathena.org/board/topic/77080-grf-grf-editor/).
* Put every file in the grf container using tokei's grf editor, starting tree structure from data/.. so the end result would look like grf/data/...
* Put grf file in the your client folder usually (C:\Program Files (x86)\NovaRO).
* Open your ``DATA.INI`` file with any text editor tool such as Notepad Add a new line after jobsprites.grf and before maps.grf with a number 3 in it. Change the Numbers so there are no doubles (i.i 3 = x.grf and 3 = y.grf)
